# Saudi-E-Commerce-RAG-Agent

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering questions about Saudi Arabia’s e-commerce sector

# 📌 Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent designed to answer queries related to the e-commerce sector in Saudi Arabia.
It uses a vector database, semantic embeddings, and an LLM-based generation pipeline to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

The project contains two parts:

RAG Agent Notebook – end-to-end implementation of document ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and answer generation.

FLAN-T5 Mini Pipeline Test – a simple demonstration using a HuggingFace pipeline.

# Features

 Upload, clean, and chunk domain-specific documents

 Embed text using high-quality embeddings

 Retrieve the most relevant chunks based on a query

Generate clear, natural-language answers using an LLM

 Fully modular and easy to customize

 Includes a simple FLAN-T5 test pipeline
